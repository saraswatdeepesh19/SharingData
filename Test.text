Document Title:
Digital Platform Monitoring Onboarding Evidence: Grafana and AppDynamics

1. Introduction
This document outlines the successful onboarding of the Digital Platform onto Grafana and AppDynamics. It provides evidence of monitoring setup for platform services, logs, and infrastructure.

2. Objectives
The objective of this onboarding is to:

Ensure real-time monitoring of all platform services and infrastructure.
Track and analyze logs for performance optimization and troubleshooting.
Provide visibility into key metrics for service health and performance using Grafana and AppDynamics.
3. Monitoring Tools Overview
3.1 Grafana
Grafana is an open-source platform used for monitoring and observability. It provides a unified interface to visualize metrics, logs, and traces. The platform's data can be collected from various sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and more.

3.2 AppDynamics
AppDynamics is a performance management solution that provides detailed insights into application performance, infrastructure, and end-user behavior. It allows real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and deep diagnostics.

4. Onboarding Overview
4.1 Grafana Onboarding
Data Sources Integrated:

Prometheus (for service metrics)
Loki (for log aggregation)
CloudWatch (for AWS infrastructure metrics)
Dashboards Created:

Services Overview Dashboard: Real-time health and performance of all platform services.
Infrastructure Dashboard: Monitoring CPU, memory, and disk usage of servers.
Log Analytics Dashboard: Aggregated logs from services for error detection.

5.3 Evidence (Screenshots):
Log Monitoring: (Insert screenshot of log queries in Grafana and error detection)
6. Alerts and Notifications
6.1 Grafana Alerts
Metrics-based alerting on service health and infrastructure usage.
Sample alerts: Memory usage above 85%, service downtime detected.
6.2 AppDynamics Alerts
Alerting based on performance anomalies and infrastructure health.
Sample alerts: High response times, CPU or memory spikes.
6.3 Evidence of Alert Configuration (Screenshots):
