Project: Talkback Feature Implementation

Objective: Implement a talkback feature that enables an element to "talk" when a user hovers over it, using HTML, JS, CSS, and jQuery.

Requirements:

1. Integrate speech recognition and synthesis libraries/APIs.
2. Create a talkable element (e.g., div, button) that triggers speech output on hover.
3. Customize speech output (text, voice, rate, pitch) as needed.
4. Ensure compatibility with supported browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge).

Technical Details:

1. Speech Recognition:
    - Library/API: Web Speech API, SpeechRecognition.js, or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
    - Language support: English (default), with potential for additional languages.
2. Speech Synthesis:
    - Library/API: Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis).
    - Voice options: Default voice, with potential for additional voices.
3. Event Handling:
    - Hover event: Trigger speech output when user hovers over talkable element.
4. Browser Support:
    - Chrome, Safari, Edge (primary support).
    - Firefox (limited support).

Next Steps:

1. Research and select suitable speech recognition and synthesis libraries/APIs.
2. Implement talkable element and hover event handling.
3. Customize speech output and test functionality.
4. Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
