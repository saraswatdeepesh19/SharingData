Subject: Request to Log Off Early Due to Eye Irritation

Dear [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I have been experiencing significant eye irritation and watery eyes today. Despite my efforts to manage it, the discomfort has persisted and is affecting my ability to focus on work tasks.

To prevent any further strain and to ensure I can recover quickly, I would like to request permission to log off early today. I will make sure to complete any urgent tasks and will be available via phone if something requires my immediate attention.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
