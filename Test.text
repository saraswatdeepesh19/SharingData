Selenium Grid Distributed Configuration
Exploration Report
This report explores the impact of configuring Selenium Grid 4.8.3 components separately (Hub,
Distributor, Session Map, Event Bus, and Nodes) compared to a standalone setup. The objective is
to understand performance, scalability, and architectural implications of distributed configurations,
especially for environments with desktop and mobile nodes (e.g., Appium).
1. Selenium Grid Components Overview
Component Purpose Default Port(s)
Router (Hub) Entry point for WebDriver requests; routes to Distributor/Sessions 4444
Distributor Allocates sessions to available Nodes 5553
Session Map Tracks active sessions and node ownership 5556
Event Bus Enables inter-component communication 4442 (Pub), 4443 (Sub)
Node Executes browser or mobile sessions Custom (e.g., 5555, 4723)
2. Performance and Scalability Impact
Area Effect Explanation
Scalability Significant Improvement Each service can be scaled independently to handle high parallel test loads.
Stability Improved Crashes in one component donâ€™t affect the others; easier recovery and maintenance.
Resource Utilization More Efficient Allows targeted resource allocation (CPU, memory) per component.
Network Overhead Slightly Higher More HTTP calls between components introduce minimal latency.
Setup Complexity Higher Requires multiple services or containers, monitoring, and coordination.
Load Balancing Better Distributor efficiently allocates sessions across diverse nodes.
Maintainability Improved Individual component updates without full grid downtime.
3. Configuration Recommendations
- Use distributed setup if you run 20+ parallel sessions or multiple node types (desktop + mobile). -
Keep Event Bus and Distributor on powerful machines to minimize bottlenecks. - Use Docker
Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration. - Maintain consistent port exposure and environment
variables across services. - For Appium integration, assign dedicated mobile nodes with limited
max-sessions (usually 1 per device).
In conclusion, configuring Selenium Grid components separately leads to substantial gains in
scalability and stability for medium to large test environments, especially when managing diverse
workloads. The trade-off is a modest increase in setup and maintenance complexity, which can be
mitigated using container orchestration tools.
