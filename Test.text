I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request paternity leave for the birth of my baby girl. My wife and I are overjoyed to welcome our new addition to the family.

I would like to take paternity leave for 10 days, starting from December 11, 2023, and concluding on December 22, 2023. During this time, I will ensure that all my responsibilities are appropriately delegated, and I am committed to completing any pending tasks before my departure.

I understand the importance of a smooth transition, and I am more than willing to work with you to ensure that the team is well-prepared for my temporary absence. I have briefed [colleague's name] about the projects I am currently working on, and I will provide detailed documentation to facilitate a seamless handover.

I believe that taking this time off will allow me to support my wife during this crucial period and bond with our new family member. I am confident in the team's ability to handle any urgent matters in my absence.

Please let me know if there are any specific procedures or forms that I need to complete to formalize this request. I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter and am looking forward to returning to work on December 23, 2023.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
